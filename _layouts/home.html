    <h1>Kyungmin Kim</h1>
    <p>Designer, cyclist based in San Francisco</p>
    <p>I currently work at <a href="http://www.premise.com" target="_blank">Premise</a>, helping the global economy to become more transparent with the mobile technology and data science. Previously, I was Interaction Designer at Google and did a stint as UX Engineer at a startup.</p>
    <p>I grew up in Korea and have a huge love for spicy food and cycling. I’m a minimalist, practical, and goal-oriented.</p>
    <p>I have a passion for cross-functional product design process. I believe, with the right process, anyone can influence great design, not just those who can use Adobe Creative Suite or Sketch. I design, code, write, and create things to continue to expand my role as a designer. I'm open to opportunities to advise or mentor designers.</p>
