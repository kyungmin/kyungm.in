    <h1>Kyungmin Kim</h1>
    <p>Product designer and problem solver</p>
    <p>I work at <a href="http://www.premise.com" target="_blank">Premise</a>, helping the global economy to become more transparent with the mobile technology and data science. Previously, I worked at Google and did a stint as Front-End Engineer at Balanced.</p>
    <p>I have a passion for making design scale and universal across teams and organizations. I believe, with the right process, anyone can influence great design, not just those who can use design tools. As I continue to expand my role as a designer, I often mentor designers and non-designers.</p>
    <p>I grew up in Korea and have a huge love for cycling and watercolor painting. </p>
